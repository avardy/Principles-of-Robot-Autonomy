# Version Note

The slides were converted using the March 2021 version of PoRA, but at this moment I don't have the source for the September 2025 version (although I do have the PDF). I will use the 2025 version for the course and the section numbers below will refer to the 2025 version.

# Chapter 1

## 1.1:
    1.1.1 covered lightly (ignore distinctions of linearity and time-invariance)
    1.1.2 covering only Example 1.1.3
## 1.2:
    1.2.1 - 1.2.4 covered fully
    1.2.5 not covered
## 1.3: Fully covered
