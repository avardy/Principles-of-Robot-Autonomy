\begin{frame}{Perception in Autonomy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Autonomy couples perception, planning, and control; sensors power the ``see'' loop.
\item Robots blend diverse exteroceptive and proprioceptive inputs to stay aware of both world and self.
\item Upcoming chapters dive into sensing hardware plus the pipelines that interpret measurements.

\begin{frame}{Sensor Taxonomy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Proprioceptive sensors observe internal robot states (motors, joints, voltages).
\item Exteroceptive sensors probe the environment (ranges, light intensity, sound levels).
\item Interpretation burden is typically higher for exteroceptive data because semantics must be inferred.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Active vs Passive Behavior}
\begin{itemize}
\item Passive sensors rely on ambient energy (thermometers, cameras) and inherit environmental variability.
\item Active sensors emit probe energy (ultrasonic, lidar) and must model round-trip propagation.
\item Classification matters because illumination control, interference, and safety constraints differ.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Design-Spec Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic range compares upper/lower input limits, often via $\text{DR}=10\log_{10}(r)$ in dB.
\item Resolution sets the minimum distinguishable increment; digital sensors can decouple it from dynamic range.
\item Linearity states whether output scales proportionally with input across the operating range.
\item Bandwidth (Hz) caps how fast fresh measurements arrive, constraining robot speed and feedback rates.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{In Situ Performance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensitivity trades signal amplification against noise amplification; cross-sensitivity captures off-axis effects.
\item Error $e = m - v$ compares measured value $m$ to truth $v$; accuracy $a = 1 - |m-v|/v$ summarizes agreement.
\item Precision tracks repeatability; a sensor can be precise yet inaccurate if bias dominates.
\end{itemize}

% In situ metrics (sensitivity, cross-sensitivity, error, accuracy, precision).
% --- Original text end ---

\begin{frame}{Systematic vs Random Errors}
\begin{itemize}
\item Systematic errors stem from deterministic, modelable causes (calibration drift, temperature bias).
\item Random errors arise from stochastic influences (specular sonar reflections, camera black-level noise).
\item Practical robots face blended regimes where environment-dependent effects blur these categories.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Concept Recap}
\begin{itemize}
\item Catalog systematic sources first, then model random terms (often Gaussian) only where justified.
\item Propagate both contributions through downstream estimators to predict accuracy and precision.
\item Revisit assumptions as environments change; ``random'' sonar failures may become systematic at fixed poses.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Modeling Uncertainty}
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability distributions approximate unresolved random errors; unimodal Gaussian assumptions ease math.
\item Real sensors (e.g., sonar, stereo) often exhibit multi-modal, biased noise when failure modes activate.
\item Always align the assumed distribution with observed operating regimes to avoid brittle estimators.

\begin{frame}{Encoder Resolution Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Resolution (cycles per revolution) dictates minimum angular increment; $2000$ CPR $\rightarrow 0.18^\circ$ steps.
\item Quadrature sensing multiplies counts by four by tracking both channel edges.
\item Controlled mounting and predictable environments keep encoder systematic errors negligible.

\begin{frame}{Heading Sensors Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compasses read Earth’s magnetic field (Hall or flux-gate) but suffer from disturbances and indoor biases.
\item Gyroscopes preserve orientation in an inertial frame and complement compasses for dead reckoning.
\item Blending these modalities via filtering mitigates individual weaknesses.

\begin{frame}{Mechanical Gyroscopes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fast-spinning rotors on gimbals resist reorientation; friction-induced torques limit long-term accuracy.
\item Reactive torque follows $\tau = I \omega \Omega$, tying drift to inertia and spin rates.
\item High-grade units can drift $0.1^\circ$ over 6 hours but remain costly relative to MEMS.

\item Lenses replace tiny apertures, refracting rays to focus more light while retaining sharpness.
\item Similar-triangle geometry yields the thin-lens equation $\tfrac{1}{z} + \tfrac{1}{Z} = \tfrac{1}{f}$.
\item Depth-of-field captures tolerable focus ranges; focusing at infinity recovers the pinhole limit.
